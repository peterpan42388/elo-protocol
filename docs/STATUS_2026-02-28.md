# Status Update (2026-02-28)

## Completed
- Requirement-conformant ELO protocol baseline documentation
- Settlement simulator implementing:
  - same owner free settlement
  - cross owner paid settlement
  - recharge/withdraw boundaries
- Unit tests passed (`npm test`)
- Demo scenario passed (`npm run demo`)
- Solidity skeleton contracts + compile artifacts (`npm run compile:solidity`)
- Local REST API adapter implemented (`register-agent`, `quote`, `settle`, `recharge`, `balance`)
- API end-to-end test passed
- Settlement replay protection implemented (`requestId` uniqueness check)
- Contract access control added:
  - `OwnerRegistry.registerAgent` restricted to registrar role
  - `ELOToken.mint` restricted to minter role
- GitHub Actions CI added (test + solidity compile on push/PR)
- Foundry test suite added:
  - unit tests (roles, free/paid paths, replay, unauthorized caller)
  - fuzz tests
  - invariant tests
- SettlementEngine hardened:
  - unique `requestId` replay guard (on-chain)
  - only `consumer` can trigger spending settlement
- Bilingual docs added:
  - technical overview
  - user guide
  - founder requirements statement
- Deployment assets added:
  - Base Sepolia deploy + scenario script
  - local Anvil deployment script
  - bilingual deployment guide
  - local broadcast verified successfully on Anvil (chain id 31337)
- Open-source governance & partial-open controls added:
  - open scope policy (what stays open vs private)
  - management plan (governance, release and risk process)
  - SECURITY/GOVERNANCE/CODEOWNERS
  - issue + PR templates
  - CI policy checks and secret scanning workflow
- Main branch protections updated:
  - required checks: `test`, `gitleaks`
  - linear history required
  - force-push and deletion disabled
  - conversation resolution required
- Private risk implementation repository created:
  - `peterpan42388/elo-risk-extension` (private)
- Pluggable risk interface delivered in public core:
  - `IRiskPolicy` interface
  - `SettlementEngine` risk hook + owner-managed policy setter
  - `ThresholdRiskPolicy` reference implementation
  - `recordSettlement` state hook for rate/window style private strategies

## Current Blocker
- GitHub CLI account token in local keyring is invalid.
- SSH auth is valid for git transport, but repository creation requires API auth.

## Resume Steps (when you return)
1. Re-authenticate GitHub CLI:
   - `gh auth login -h github.com`
2. Create and push public repo:
   - `gh repo create peterpan42388/elo-protocol --public --source=. --remote=origin --push`

## Next Development Targets
1. Add Solidity unit tests (same-owner free and cross-owner transfer)
2. Add REST adapter (`quote`, `settle`, `recharge`)
3. Add x402 compatibility mapping doc
